One         evening                             when         I         was
        still         living                             at         Grand
        Street                             and         Monroe,
                                               Isamu         Noguchi
                    came         to         visit         me.


                               There         was         nothing         in
        the         room                             (no         
furniture,                                                           no
   paintings).
                                                                                    The
        floor         was         covered,
                           wall          to          wall,
                                        with          cocoa         
matting.
                                                                           The
   windows         had         no         curtains,
                                        no         drapes.

                                          Isamu          Noguchi         
said,                                                           “An         old
         shoe                              would          look         
beautiful                             in         this          room.”
